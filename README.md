Homework 4 - jQuery 

Crystal Collector Game coded using jQuery

Instructions: 
You are given a random number at the start of the game. There are four crystals below. By clicking on a crystal, you add a specific amount of points to your total score.
The value of each crystal is assigned randomly and you can figure them out once you click on each gem. Each time the game starts, the value of the crystals changes.
You win the game by matching your total score to the target score; you lose the game if your total score exceeds the target score.
